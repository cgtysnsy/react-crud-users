### 2- Create Components State Data

---

> What I practiced?

- Passing data to components
- Fetch api calls
- Condtional rendering
- Debugging
- Hooks, useState, useEffect
- Loading feature
- Arrow functions
- Rendering list data with map
- Filtering data
- Filter by name, surname
- setState callbacks
- Stateless functional components
- Project structure
- Update and delete functionality for components
- Before remove user, modal opens and asking for confirmation

## Tasks to do

- Pagination

## What I learnt

- It is better to keep input states its own component.
- Important; setting the state is asynchronous, we need to define a callback function for changing the state at the same time. For the hooks "useState".
